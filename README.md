# Introduction

AZ3166 is an IoT development kit based on EMW3166 developed by Shanghai MXCHIP Information Technology Co., Ltd. and Microsoft asia-pacific technology Co., Ltd. The development kit provides a smart hardware solution. It is compatible with Arduino with abundant peripherals and sensors. AZ3166 could be used for the development of IoT and smart hardware prototype, making it continent to verify the software and function of users. Product could connect to Azure and mobile phone fast and safely. With AZ3166, customers could cut down the period of research. AZ3166 has software and hardware and would be supported with developer community, including development kit and demo for quick connection to cloud service. Control and operation could be obtained by mobile phone or tablet.

In this guide you could konw how to connecting AZ3166 to Azure, sending and receiving data through Azure.

# Step 1: Prepare Device

**What you need**

 - AZ3166 board
 - Micro USB cable

# Step 2: Prepare SDK

**Compiling Environment**

 - Python is required in compiling. Download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/).
 - Git
 - mbed CLI. For how to Install mbed CLI, please follow the link: [https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/dev_tools/cli/](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/dev_tools/cli/)
 - GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain 4.9-2015-q3 is required in compiling. Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/).

After install mbed CLI and GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain, configure mbed in sdk file by using cmd command:

<pre>
mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH ****
</pre>

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

**A. Configure WiFi**

Configure WiFi in main.cpp, input Wifi SSID and password in main.app as shown below.

<pre>
int ret = wlan.connect( "****", "****", NSAPI_SECURITY_WPA_WPA2, 0 );
</pre>

As well as in mbed_app.json.

<pre>
        "wifi-ssid": {
            "value": "\"****\""
        },
        "wifi-password": {
            "value": "\"****\""
        }
</pre>

**B. Configure Device Registration**

 -	[Regist azure.microsoft account](https://azure.microsoft.com/zh-cn/free/) to get free account for iothub.
 -	Add iothub service in azure cloud control center.
 -	Install [Azure tool(Azure CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-lesson2-get-azure-tools-win32) on your computer.
 -	Click [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to download and install DeviceExplorerï¼Œyou will register your device using DeviceExplorer. Fllowing [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/iotcertification/iot_certification_port_c_libraries_other_platforms/iot_certification_port_c_libraries_other_platforms.md) to study how to regist your device.
 - Configure device information in iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c. As shown below.

<pre>
static const char* connectionString = "HostName=****;DeviceId=****;SharedAccessKey=****";
</pre>

**C. Build the Sample**

Use the following command(Command Prompt on Windows, or Terminal on Mac OS X)

<pre>
     mbed compile -m AZ3166 -t GCC_ARM
</pre>

After compile the sample. a `.bin` file would be generated in the path: `...\mbed-wifi-example\BUILD\AZ3166\GCC_ARM`.

**D. Download Firmware to DevKit**

Once the DevKit is connected, you will see a new USB mass storage device in your File Explorer.

Drag & drop the `.bin` file you compiled to AZ3166 device.

Wait until file copied, the DevKit will reboot to the latest firmware.

# Step 4: Results

Az3166 would send data to Iothub-explorer and Iothub-explorer would receive the data.

At the same time,you can send message to Az3166 from iothub-explorer.
